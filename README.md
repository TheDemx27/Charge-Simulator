# Charge-Simulator

A simulation created for understanding the nature of [line charges](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.18236?class=pdf). This graph produces the expected distribution of charge density when the charges are confined to a line. The charge density is much higher at the ends of the line.
